                        Nihon Ki-in (Japanese: 一般公益法人日本棋院 / Ippankōekihōjin Nihon Kiin) is the largest Go organization
                        in Japan, responsible for organizing various Go tournaments. Its headquarters is located in
                        Chiyoda, Tokyo, and it also has regional headquarters in Nagoya and Osaka. Currently, Nihon
                        Ki-in has about 300 professional Go players.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nihon Ki-in was established in 1924 by the merger of the two largest Go organizations at the
                        time, the Honinbo School and the Hōen-sha, with the support of Okura Kishichirō. After its
                        establishment, Nihon Ki-in has had competition with organizations and individuals such as the
                        Kisei-sha, Wu Qingyuan, and the Go Shinsha. In 1950, a group of players led by Hashimoto Utarō
                        broke away from Nihon Ki-in and established the Kansai Ki-in.
                    </p>
                    <p>Its organizations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tokyo Headquarters</li>

                    <h3>Nihon Ki-in Title Matches</h3>
                    <p>
                        The seven major Go tournaments in Japan, ranked by prize money, are the Kisei, Meijin, Honinbo,
                        Oza, Tengen, Gosei, and Judan. Among them, the top three tournaments—Kisei, Meijin, and
                        Honinbo—are collectively known as the "Three Major Title Matches." The Kisei title is the
                        highest honor. If a player holds all three titles simultaneously, it is referred to as the
                        "Triple Crown."
                        There are many professional tournaments, but what makes the "Seven Major Title Matches"
                        different from other competitions?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most significant feature of the Seven Major Title Matches is that all players are eligible
                        to participate, though the way challengers are selected varies. For the Meijin and Honinbo
                        tournaments, players enter a league after a preliminary round, and qualifying for the league is
                        an indication of being a top-level player.
                    </p>
                    <p>The prize money for the title matches is as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Kisei: 45 million yen</li>
                        <li>Judan: 7 million yen</li>
                        <li>Honinbo: 28 million yen</li>
                        <li>Gosei: 8 million yen</li>
                        <li>Meijin: 30 million yen</li>
                        <li>Oza: 14 million yen</li>
                        <li>Tengen: 13 million yen</li>
