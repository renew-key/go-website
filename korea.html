                also one of the Four Arts of ancient Chinese scholars, alongside the guqin (琴), calligraphy (書), and

            <p> The Korea Baduk Association (Korean: 한국기원) is the governing body of professional Go in South Korea. Its
                history dates back to November 1945 when Zhao Nan-zhe founded the Seoul Baduk Institute. </p>
            <p> In 1937, Zhao Nan-zhe went to Japan to study under the Go master Kitani Minoru 9-dan. He returned to
                Korea in 1945 and established the Go institute. Traditionally, Koreans opened with a "sunjang" method,
                but after establishing the Korea Baduk Association, Zhao persuaded Koreans to use the "white board"
                opening method. In 1956, he founded the National Go Championship, promoting Go competitions to the
                public. </p>

            <div class="player">
                <h4>Cho Nam-chul</h4>
                <h5>
                    Cho Nam-chul (Korean: 조남철, November 30, 1923 – July 2, 2006) was a South Korean 9-dan professional
                    Go player, known as the father of modern Korean Go.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In 1946, Cho Nam-chul founded the Seoul Go Institute, marking the official beginning of professional
                    Go in South Korea. In 1950, under Cho's organization, Korea held its first modern Go ranking
                    tournament, where Cho was ranked as 3-dan, and others were given the rank of 1-dan. In 1955, Cho
                    persuaded President Syngman Rhee to send a professional Go delegation to Taiwan to compete in an
                    international match, where they achieved victory. This victory boosted the morale of the Korean
                    people and brought Cho and modern Go into the spotlight. Soon after, Korea's professional Go
                    tournaments were established, and in 1968, the Seoul Go Institute was rebuilt and renamed the Korea
                    Baduk Association.
                    After the 1950s, Cho dominated the Korean Go scene for a long time until the younger player Kim In
                    became the dominant force after returning from Japan. In 1983, Cho was awarded the 9-dan rank, and
                    in 1994, he became the oldest player to qualify for the National Go Championship. His nephew, Cho
                    Chih-hun, went to Japan to study under his support and later became the top Go player in Japan.

                <h4>Cho Hun-hyeon</h4>
                <h5>
                    Cho Hun-hyeon (Korean: 조훈현, March 10, 1953 – ), a famous South Korean Go player, is a 9-dan
                    professional at the Korea Baduk Association. He is a nine-time world champion and one of the first
                    generation pioneers of modern Korean Go, revered as the "Emperor of Go."
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Cho Hun-hyeon is the mentor of Lee Chang-ho, the world champion record-holder, and together they are
                    known as the "Cho-Lee duo." Along with Liu Chang-he and Seo Bong-su, they are referred to as the
                    "Four Great Kings of Korea." From the 1990s to the mid-2000s, these four players dominated the world
                    of Go.
                    Cho was born in Mokpo, South Jeolla Province, and became a professional in 1962, making him the
                    youngest professional player in Korea Baduk Association history at the age of 9 years and 7 months.
                    In 1963, Cho moved to Japan to study Go and trained under Sesojun Kenjaku. After returning to Korea,
                    Cho became dominant, winning over 130 domestic titles and elevating to 9-dan in 1982. In 1989, Cho
                    defeated China’s Nie Weiping in the inaugural Ing Cup, 3-2, sparking a Go boom in Korea and
                    cementing his status as a national hero.

            <div class="player">
                <h4>Lee Chang-ho</h4>
                <h5>
                    Lee Chang-ho (Korean: 이창호, July 29, 1975 – ) is a Go player from Jeonju, North Jeolla Province,
                    South Korea. He is the second-generation leader of Korean Go and is considered one of the greatest
                    players in modern Go history, second only to Wu Qingyuan, often referred to as "In the 20th century
                    Go, before Wu Qingyuan, after Lee Chang-ho."
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Lee began playing professionally at the age of 11 in 1986, just behind Cho Hun-hyeon, who started at
                    9. In 1992, Lee became the youngest world champion at 15 years and 6 months, a record still
                    unbroken. In 1996, the Korea Baduk Association granted him a direct promotion to 9-dan alongside Liu
                    Chang-he. Lee has won all major Korean titles and is recognized for dominating the international Go
                    scene between 1992 and 2012, particularly during the "Lee Chang-ho Era" from 1996 to 2006.
                    Over his career, Lee won 17 world championships and 21 international titles, ranking first in the
                    world. He is celebrated not only as a champion in individual competitions but also as a hero in team
                    competitions, where he achieved a remarkable 14 consecutive wins in the Three Kingdoms Championship,
                    with 29 wins and 7 losses. Lee is revered as a "guardian god" by Korean fans, and his opponents in
                    China and Japan refer to him as the "Iron Gate."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lee Chang-ho is part of Korea’s "Old Four Kings" along with Cho Hun-hyeon, Seo Bong-su, and Liu
                    Chang-he. He is also part of the "New Four Kings" with Lee Se-dol, Park Young-hun, and Choi
                    Jeong-hwan. Together with Chinese player Gu Li, they are called the "Twin Heroes." However, despite
                    the similarities in name pronunciation, domestic records, and their match-ups with China's Chang
                    Hao, Lee's international achievements and head-to-head results are far superior.

            <div class="player">
                <h4>Lee Se-dol</h4>
                <h5>
                    Lee Se-dol (Korean: 이세돌, March 2, 1983 – ), a South Korean 9-dan Go player, grew up in the village
                    of Baegimdo in Sinan County, Jeollanam-do, which earned him the nickname "Baegimdo Boy." Early in
                    his career, he achieved remarkable results in Korea and was called the "Undefeated Boy." He is the
                    third-generation leader of Korean Go, and alongside Lee Chang-ho, is known as the "Big and Small
                    Lee." He is also part of the "New Four Kings" along with Lee Chang-ho, Park Young-hun, and Choi
                    Jeong-hwan, and is considered one of the "Twin Heroes" with Chinese player Gu Li.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Lee Se-dol is known for his sharp and aggressive style, especially in large-scale attacks, and was
                    famously referred to as "Fourteen-Dan" during his middle game. However, as he matured, he became a
                    more well-rounded player, capable of both offense and defense. His style became softer and more
                    unpredictable, often creating "ghost moves" and winning in extraordinary ways. He is also famous for
                    his mental strength, often making comebacks in major world championships.
                    Lee's rivalry with Chinese player Gu Li between 2005 and 2010 attracted great attention, with their
                    records being nearly even, solidifying them as the top two players of the time. In 2016, Lee
                    famously competed against Google's AlphaGo program in a five-game match. Although he lost 1-4, his
                    single victory showed that humans could still defeat computers.
