            <h3>Go is a strategic board game played on a grid-based board with black and white stones. It originated in
                China and was historically known by various names such as "Yi" (弈), "Qi" (碁), and "Shou Tan" (手談). Go is
                also one of the Four Arts of ancient Chinese scholars, alongside the guqin (琴), calligraphy (書), and
                painting (畫).</h3>

            <h3>Origins of Go</h3>
            <p>According to legend, Go was invented around 2300 BCE by Emperor Yao. His son, Dan Zhu, was arrogant and
                impulsive, so Emperor Yao created the game of Go to cultivate his son's temperament.</p>
            <p>Go is played with black and white stones. The player with the black stones moves first. The two players
                take turns placing stones at the intersections of a 19x19 grid on the board. Once placed, a stone cannot
                be moved or removed by the player. The objective is to enclose territory and capture the opponent’s
                stones. The winner is determined by the amount of territory controlled.</p>
            <p>The rules of Go are simple and elegant, yet the gameplay is highly complex and varied. Mastering the game
                requires extensive practice and study. Chess Grandmaster Emanuel Lasker once praised Go, saying, "If
                there are intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they almost certainly play Go." Go is considered
                one of the most complex board games in the world, with its complexity proven to be PSPACE-hard by
                Robertson and Munro in 1978.</p>
            <p>As of mid-2008, there were over 40 million Go players worldwide, the vast majority residing in East Asia.
                By the end of 2020, the International Go Federation had 77 member countries and five affiliated
                organizations.</p>
            <hr />

            <h3>Modern Go</h3>
            <p>After the Meiji Restoration, Go players lost financial support from the shogunate and had to seek new
                ways to earn a living. This led to the emergence of newspaper-sponsored tournaments and the modern
                ranking system, as well as the establishment of the Nihon Ki-in (Japanese Go Association). During the
                Showa era, Go Seigen and Kitani Minoru pioneered the "New Opening" movement, marking the beginning of
                modern Go. Subsequently, top players such as Sakata Eio, Fujisawa Hideyuki, Takagawa Kaku, Otake Hideo,
                Ishida Yoshio, Takemiya Masaki, and Kobayashi Koichi emerged in Japan.</p>
            <p>In 1989, South Korean player Cho Hunhyun won the first Ing Cup World Go Championship, igniting a Go boom
                in South Korea. This was followed by the rise of numerous international Go tournaments. Among them, Lee
                Changho dominated the Go world, becoming the top player of his time. However, after 2006, his dominance
                declined as new players like Lee Sedol and Gu Li challenged him, leading to an era of rivalry between Gu
                Li and Lee Sedol.</p>
            <p>In the 2010s, a new generation of Chinese players emerged. Young talents such as Jiang Weijie, Fan
                Tingyu, Shi Yue, Mi Yuting, Chen Yaoye, Zhou Ruiyang, and Tan Xiao won multiple world championships,
                solidifying China's prominence in the Go world.</p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Go Culture</h3>
            <p>Over its thousands of years of history, Go has developed a rich vocabulary of specialized terminology,
                some of which has entered common language, such as the term "endgame" (收官). Nearly every move in Go has
                a corresponding term, making it possible to describe entire sequences in written form. For example:</p>
            <p>"Black occupies the star point in the upper right corner, White plays a small knight's approach, Black
                responds with a two-space high pincer, White jumps one space, Black follows with a jump, White plays a
                small knight's move into the corner, Black blocks at the 3-3 point..."

                This description, using Go terminology, vividly depicts a common joseki sequence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Atari (叫吃): A move that puts an opponent's stone in immediate danger of capture.</li>
                <li>Liberty (氣): The empty intersections adjacent to a stone. A single stone has at most four liberties,
                    but connected stones can have more. When a player's move reduces an opponent's liberties, it is
                    called "tightening liberties" (緊氣).</li>
                <li>Capture (提): Removing stones with no remaining liberties from the board. This action is called
                    "capturing" (提子).</li>
                <li>Point (目): An empty intersection enclosed by one player's stones, contributing to their final score.
                </li>
                <li>Territory (地): The total number of points enclosed by a player's living stones.</li>
                <li>Void (空): An enclosed area on the board.</li>
                <li>Ko (劫): A situation where both players can repeatedly capture and recapture a single stone. The
                    rules of Go state that a player cannot immediately recapture in a ko situation without making a move
                    elsewhere first, a rule known as the "ko fight" (劫爭).</li>
            </ul>
