            <h3>Go is a strategic board game played on a grid-based board with black and white stones. It originated in
                China and was historically known by various names such as "Yi" (弈), "Qi" (碁), and "Shou Tan" (手談). Go is
                also one of the Four Arts of ancient Chinese scholars, alongside the guqin (琴), calligraphy (書), and
                painting (畫).</h3>

            <h3>China Chess Academy</h3>
            <p>
                On March 15, 1992, the grand opening ceremony of the China Chess Academy was held. The academy, which
                started construction in October 1988, took over three years to complete. The China Chess Academy,
                directly under the National Sports Commission, is a comprehensive training base and competition venue
                for Chinese chess sports. It is responsible for managing the national Go, Xiangqi (Chinese chess), and
                International Chess teams' training, organizing major national and international competitions in all
                three chess categories, and hosting various public chess activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In November 2019, the China Chess Academy was designated as the protection unit for the national
                intangible cultural heritage project "Xiangqi."
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>China Go League (A-League)</h3>
            <p>
                The first year had only ten teams, with a home-and-away system consisting of 18 rounds. Since then, each
                competition has had twelve teams, with 22 rounds in total. Each club can send 4 players out of a team of
                6. Players are not limited to those from the China Chess Academy, with many Korean and Japanese foreign
                players appearing in both the A-League and B-League.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last two teams in the A-League are relegated to the B-League, while the top two teams from the
                B-League are promoted to the A-League. Since 2006, there has been a championship match between the
                A-League champion and the Korean league champion.
