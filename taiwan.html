            <h3>Go is a strategic board game played on a grid-based board with black and white stones. It originated in
                China and was historically known by various names such as "Yi" (弈), "Qi" (碁), and "Shou Tan" (手談). Go is
                also one of the Four Arts of ancient Chinese scholars, alongside the guqin (琴), calligraphy (書), and
                painting (畫).</h3>

            <h3>About Haifeng</h3>
            <p>
                In 1997, Mr. Lin Wenbo, driven by his love for Go, decided to donate 30 million yuan to establish a
                foundation aimed at promoting Go. After consulting with National Go Master Lin Haifeng, he received full
                support and was promised to serve as the first chairman. The "Haifeng Cultural and Educational
                Foundation" was thus established, launching the cause of promoting Go.
                Due to the significant investment of both money and manpower required for organizing professional and
                amateur competitions, the Haifeng Foundation has been generously funded by Chairman Lin Wenbo over the
                years, leading to rapid growth. However, the foundation still faced difficulties in hosting professional
                tournaments. As a result, organizational adjustments were necessary. Chairman Lin decided to merge the
                "Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation" with the "Pearson Cultural and Educational Foundation" to
                create synergies greater than the sum of their parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Pearson Cultural and Educational Foundation, another foundation funded by Chairman Lin Wenbo and his
                family, has long been dedicated to special education. As its financial resources are more abundant than
                those of the Haifeng Foundation, after the merger, the Haifeng Foundation ceased its operations and
                handed over the responsibility of promoting the Go movement to the "Pearson Cultural and Educational
                Foundation." The original staff of the Haifeng Foundation was restructured and reorganized into the
                "Haifeng Go Institute" to continue their efforts in promoting Go on the front lines.
